# bitsquare

Decentralized Bitcoin exchange service, trustless, peer to peer.

# How it works

Bitcoins are stored in a multisig address (P2SH) locked with 2-out-of-3 signatures [seller ; buyer ; server] where the server acts as an arbitrator in case of a dispute between seller and buyer. Arbitration is subject to manual verification of the contract terms between seller and buyer.

#  Costs

Service charges a 0.5% commission of the traded amount.
